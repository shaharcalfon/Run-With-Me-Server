# RunWithMe-Server
RunWithMe is a group running mobile application developed by Shahar Chalfon, Lior Lapid and Erez Lev as part of their B.sc, Computer Science final project in the Academic College of Tel-Aviv-Yafo.
This application offers users a real-time running screen which provides a route and statistical data regarding the run.
The app supports both solo and group runs, as well as a complete Running Group feature to invite your friends and perform group runs together!
Post-run statistical summaries offer the user easy tracking of his running performance, including detailed graph comparisons between all group run participants and/or a runner's past performances.
